Radium was discovered by M. andMme. Curie, of Paris, who in 1902 separated compounds of it by atedious process from pitchblende. Its compounds color flames carmineand give a characteristic spectrum. It resembles barium chemically.Radium preparations are remarkable for maintaining themselves at ahigher temperature than their surroundings, and for their radiations,which are of three kinds: alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays (seethese terms). By reason of these rays they ionize gases, affectphotographic plates, cause sores on the skin, and produce many otherstriking effects. Their degree of activity depends on the proportionof radium present, but not on its state of chemical combination or onexternal conditions.The radioactivity of radium is therefore anatomic property, and is explained as result from a disintegration ofthe atom. This breaking up occurs in at least seven stages; thesuccessive main products have been studied and are called radiumemanation or exradio, radium A, radium B, radium C, etc. (Theemanation is a heavy gas, the later products are solids.) Theseproducts are regarded as unstable elements, each with an atomicweight a little lower than its predecessor. It is possible that leadis the stable end product. At the same time the light gas helium isformed; it probably consists of the expelled alpha particles. Theheat effect mentioned above is ascribed to the impacts of theseparticles. Radium, in turn, is believed to be formed indirectly by animmeasurably slow disintegration of uranium."},{"word":"REMOVE","definition":"To change place in any manner, or to make a change in place; tomove or go from one residence, position, or place to another.Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane, I can not taint with fear.Shak."},{"word":"REIMPOSE","definition":"To impose anew."},{"word":"RECTORATE","definition":"The office, rank, or station of a rector; rectorship."},{"word":"REPRIVE","definition":"To take back or away.

Numa added two months, Januarius at the beginning of the year,and Februarius at the end, making in all 355 days. He also ordered anintercalary month, Mercedinus, to be inserted every second year.Later the order of the months was changed so that January should comebefore February. Through abuse of power by the pontiffs to whose careit was committed, this calendar fell into confusion. It was replacedby the Julian calendar. In designating the days of the month, theRomans reckoned backward from three fixed points, the calends, thenones, and the ides. The calends were always the first day of themonth. The ides fell on the 15th in March, May, July (Quintilis), andOctober, and on the 13th in other months. The nones came on theeighth day (the ninth, counting the ides) before the ides. Thus, Jan.13 was called the ides of January, Jan. 12, the day before the ides,and Jan. 11, the third day before the ides (since the ides count asone), while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February."},{"word":"RHINE","definition":"A water course; a ditch.
