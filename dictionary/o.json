Subjective is usedby William of Occam to denote that which exists independent of mind;objective, what is formed by the mind. This shows what is meant byrealitas objectiva in Descartes. Kant and Fichte have inverted themeanings. Subject, with them, is the mind which knows; object, thatwhich is known; subjective, the varying conditions of the knowingmind; objective, that which is in the constant nature of the thingknown. Trendelenburg.Objective means that which belongs to, or proceeds from, the objectknown, and not from the subject knowing, and thus denotes what isreal, in opposition to that which is ideal -- what exists in nature,in contrast to what exists merely in the thought of the individual.Sir. W. Hamilton.Objective has come to mean that which has independent exostence orauthority, apart from our experience or thought.
